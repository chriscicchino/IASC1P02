		<p>Utilizing technology and skilled craftspeople we are able to produce the most intricate and demanding designs. Having vast experience working with architectural materials such as wood, laminates, metal, plastic, marble &amp; stone, solid surface and lighting, we are able to produce a wide spectrum of quality and unique pieces. <p/><br />
		<p>At <mark>Niagara Store Fixtures Inc.</mark> we are able to work from supplied drawings or design our own projects utilizing computer aided design. Working from a simple sketch or architectural drawings, we are able to turn the design into reality.</p><br />
		<p>Strategic insight, exceptional design, impeccable craftsmanship, and commitment to managing every step of the process. Having built thousands of retail environments for hundreds of North America’s largest and smallest brands, we know what it takes to grow a retail business from their 3rd location to their 4th, or from their 10th to their 20th, or even from their 100th to their 1000th.</p><br />
		<p><strong>RESEARCH &amp; STRATEGY</strong> Understanding every aspect of your business.A curious, questioning, and collaborative approach makes sure we understand every aspect of your business, brand, and program.
		Consistently willing to do whatever it takes, we will design and build a retail environment your competitors will be envious of - an experience shoppers will feel, intangible elements that will draw them in, all while contributing to your bottom line.</p><br />
		<p><strong>DESIGN &amp; PROTOTYPING</strong><br />

		 Everything you could possibly need under one roof.Having all capabilities in-house means that "custom" isn’t limited to a single material or substrate,. You can mix, and match materials while pushing design and engineering limitations, or simply dress up standard products to achieve the look and function your retail environment needs.</p><br />
		<p><strong>EXECUTE</strong><br />
		 Execution is everything: high standards and quality craftsmanship.The greatest plans are nothing if they are not well executed — the same holds true for your fixtures and retail space. At CBSF we’ll do whatever it takes to get you to opening day on time and on budget.</p><br />
